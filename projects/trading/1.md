## Turnaround Tuesday

**Project description:** This investment or trading approach that focuses on taking advantage of a potential reversal or bounce in the market on Tuesdays. This strategy is based on the observation that Tuesdays tend to exhibit a higher likelihood of reversals or counter-trend moves compared to other days of the week.

The basic concept behind the Turnaround Tuesday strategy is to identify assets (such as stocks, currencies, or commodities) that have experienced a significant decline or rally leading up to Tuesday. Traders then look for signs of a potential reversal or shift in sentiment that could result in a bounce or correction.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from trading.utils.multi_index import multi_index_append_column


class TurnaroundTuesdayAnalysis:

    def __call__(self, strategy, prices, volatility_window, volatility_target):

        prices = prices.dropna()
        prices = prices.pivot(columns='instrument_name')

        prices['dow'] = prices.index.dayofweek

        volatility_target = pd.DataFrame(volatility_target, columns=prices['close'].columns,
                                         index=prices['close'].index)
        prices = multi_index_append_column(prices, volatility_target, column_name='volatility_target')

        close = prices['close']
        close = close[close.columns[0]]
        close_pct_change = pd.to_numeric(close, errors='coerce').pct_change()
        signal = ((close_pct_change <= -0.01) & (prices['dow'] == 0)).astype(float)
        signal = ((signal == 1.0) | ((prices['dow'] == 1) & (signal.shift(-1) == 1.0))).astype(float)
        signal = pd.DataFrame(signal, columns=prices['close'].columns,
                                         index=prices['close'].index)

        prices = multi_index_append_column(prices, signal, column_name='signal')

        # heuristic scaling approach dividing by square root of time (average % exposure over total time)
        # approximates strategy realised volatility

        reference_size = np.divide(
            np.divide(prices['volatility_target'], np.sqrt(1 / 5)), prices['volatility'].values
        )
        prices = multi_index_append_column(prices, reference_size, column_name='reference_size')

        return prices
