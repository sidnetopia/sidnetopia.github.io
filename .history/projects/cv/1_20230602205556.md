**Project description:** Drawings have been interpreted in various ways throughout different periods, making it challenging to provide a definitive definition. These drawings, created using different techniques, have been utilized to assess a child's intelligence. Numerous studies have examined children's drawings, including Goodenough's (1926) research, which involved extracting information from the depicted subject to predict mental age and intelligence quotient (IQ). Additionally, computer-aided tests have become increasingly significant in recent research, as they offer a more suitable approach for detecting categorical drawing characteristics using mathematical models.

Therefore, the aim of this project is to computerize Goodenough's (1926) research. By utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the sketch processor, the project classifies drawings into specific mental age categories and determines corresponding intelligence quotient (IQ) based on its learned or trained knowledge. Three methods were employed for image processing: the Basic CNN Structure, CNN Architecture with Sparse Matrix, and CNN Architecture with Sparse Matrix (Halved). These methods were tested using two types of fully connected layers: 256 and 512 Fully Connected Layers.

Among the trained methods, the Basic Model with a 512 fully connected layer demonstrated the highest performance, achieving a validation accuracy of 92% and a training accuracy peak of 82%. The Confusion Matrix displayed an accuracy of 89.97% and an error rate of 0.10, while the Categorical Cross Entropy yielded an accuracy of 89.97% and a score of 32.20%. Consequently, this model was selected for further analysis. This project provides evidence of the computer's potential to predict a child's Intelligence Quotient based on their drawings.

### 2. Data Gathering and Augmentation

The elementary pupils of NDMU-IBED were administered the Draw-a-Person test (Goodenough, 1926) using paper and pencil. This test aimed to assess their ability to draw a person. Prior to conducting the test, the researchers obtained permission from the school authorities.

To enhance the accuracy of the results and ensure reliable labels, examples from Goodenough's book (1926) were included as additional data in this study. These examples were validated by the author of the book. Furthermore, the inclusion of this data served to increase the sample size and filter out classes with insufficient data.
