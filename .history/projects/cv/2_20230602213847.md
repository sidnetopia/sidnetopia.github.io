**Project description:** The purpose of this app is to enable automatic counting and monitoring of the passenger count as they embark and disembark the vehicle at various stops.

### 2. Detecting the passenger

The Draw-a-Person test was administered to elementary pupils to assess their ability to draw a person. Additional data from Goodenough's book was included to improve accuracy and increase the sample size. The collected drawings underwent scanning, noise removal, whitespace trimming, and resizing. The dataset was split and augmented by rotating the drawings. Misinterpreted or obstructed drawings were clustered to train the model to recognize and avoid misclassification. The goal was to enhance the model's ability to distinguish flawed instances in representing figures accurately. Below are the sample from the dataset.

### 3. Model Selection and Validation

During the model selection process, three models were chosen. Firstly, a basic CNN model was employed, utilizing shallow convolutional neural networks. Additionally, we incorporated the sparse convolutional model proposed by Sunghaba (2017), as it was considered one of the novel sketch classifiers at the time of this project's creation. Furthermore, we made necessary modifications to adapt the model to our specific requirements. The best model sparse convolutional model was selected with an F1-score of 80% on test set. Below are the model architecture, and confusion matrix.
