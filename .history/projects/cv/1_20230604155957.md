## Predicting Intelligence Quotient of Children Through a Drawing Application

**Project description:** This project aims to computerize [[1]](#1) research on children's drawings by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a sketch processor. Three image processing methods were employed, including a basic CNN structure, CNN architecture with sparse matrix, and CNN architecture with sparse matrix (halved). The performance of these methods was evaluated using fully connected layers of different sizes. Among them, the basic model with a 512 fully connected layer demonstrated the highest performance with a validation accuracy of 92% and a training accuracy peak of 82%. The selected model shows the potential of computers in predicting a child's Intelligence Quotient (IQ) based on their drawings.

### Overview of the Project

The first part of this project involves building, selecting, and evaluating models using the collected dataset. The second part is to deploy the model in an application. The project works by first having children draw a representation of a person. The model then classifies the drawing based on the drawing's mental age. The mental age ranges from M1 for random or sketch drawings to M2-M16 for a mental age of 2 to 16. By combining the mental age classification with the drawer's actual age, the system computes the IQ. This is based on the test administered by [[1]](#1).

### Data Gathering and Augmentation

The Draw-a-Person test was administered to elementary pupils to assess their ability to draw a person. Additional data from [[1]](#1) was included to improve accuracy and increase the sample size. The collected drawings underwent scanning, noise removal, whitespace trimming, and resizing. The dataset was split and augmented by rotating the drawings. Misinterpreted or obstructed drawings were clustered to a certain classto train the model to recognize and avoid misclassification. The goal was to enhance the model's ability to distinguish flawed instances in representing figures accurately. Below are the sample from the dataset.

### Model Selection and Validation

During the model selection process, we choose three models. Firstly, a basic CNN model was employed, utilizing shallow convolutional neural networks. Additionally, we incorporated the sparse convolutional model proposed by Sunghaba (2017), as it was considered one of the novel sketch classifiers at the time of this project's creation. Furthermore, we made necessary modifications to adapt the model to our specific requirements. Below are the results of the model.

| Model                  | F1-Score |
| ---------------------- | -------- |
| Basic CNN              | 80%      |
| Modified Sparse Matrix | 83%      |
| Sparse Matrix          | 86%      |

The CNN sparse matrix plays a crucial role in drawing classification. It is noteworthy because it effectively captures the sparse and unique nature of sketches. Unlike standard dense matrices that represent all pixels in an image, the sparse matrix focuses only on the relevant and distinguishing features of the sketch. This sparse representation reduces computational complexity and memory constraints, making sketch categorization more efficient and cost-effective.

As observed from the confusion matrix, the sparse matrix demonstrates high accuracy in classifying the drawings. However, there are misclassifications for certain classes, specifically M7-M13. Upon reviewing the drawings, it becomes evident that these drawings share similarities, with the differences mainly lying in the fingertip or facial features. This highlights the need for further research to effectively capture these subtle details.
