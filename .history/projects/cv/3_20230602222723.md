## Mutual Learning Approach to Distracted Driver Behavior Detection

**Project description:** Distracted driver behavior recognition aims to alert the driver of distracted driving
to prevent accidents. For now, Computer Vision-based methods can recognize
distracted driver behavior at levels of accuracy using discriminative features.
Among these methods, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (Deep CNN) are the
mainstream approach and proceeds in recognizing distracted driver behavior by
extracting abstracted features from the convolutional layers. This work seeks to
investigate the possible mutual learning among specific-object detectors so that
accuracy is enhanced further when their results are combined to obtain a general
scene understanding of the driver’s cabin space. In turn, the scene that is recognized
is used to revisit the predicted objects (and their location in the cabin) for
each of the specific-object detectors. The specific-object detectors are trained to
recognize specific objects, and their location in the driver’s cabin. These objects
include the driver’s face, hand(s), steering wheel, cigarette, handphone, sandwich,
coffee mug, etc.

### 2. Detecting the passenger

The app currently employs conventional computer vision techniques to accomplish the following tasks:

Differentiate the foreground object (i.e., passenger) from the background.
Identify pixels that belong to the same foreground object.
These operations involve standard computer vision procedures such as erosion, dilation, background subtraction, and contour detection.

### 3. Recognizing the Passenger

The application quantifies the "color distribution" linked to an individual as they board the vehicle.

The application utilizes the "color distribution" to identify an individual as they disembark from the vehicle.

Subsequently, the application computes the "similarity" between the image of the departing passenger and each passenger present inside the vehicle.

The application then chooses the image that exhibits the highest level of similarity.
