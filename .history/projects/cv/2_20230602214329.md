### 2. Detecting the passenger

The app current uses traditional computer vision methods to:

-   Separate the foreground object (i.e., passenger) from the background.
-   Recognize pixels belonging to the same foreground object.

This involves only classical CV operations involved:

-   Erosion
-   Dilation
-   Background subtraction
-   Contour detection
