**Project description:** This project aims to computerize Goodenough's (1926) research on children's drawings by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a sketch processor. Three image processing methods were employed, including a basic CNN structure, CNN architecture with sparse matrix, and CNN architecture with sparse matrix (halved). The performance of these methods was evaluated using fully connected layers of different sizes. Among them, the basic model with a 512 fully connected layer demonstrated the highest performance with a validation accuracy of 92% and a training accuracy peak of 82%. The selected model shows the potential of computers in predicting a child's Intelligence Quotient (IQ) based on their drawings.

### 2. Data Gathering and Augmentation

The Draw-a-Person test was administered to elementary pupils to assess their ability to draw a person. Additional data from Goodenough's book was included to improve accuracy and increase the sample size. The collected drawings underwent scanning, noise removal, whitespace trimming, and resizing. The dataset was split and augmented by rotating the drawings. Misinterpreted or obstructed drawings were clustered to train the model to recognize and avoid misclassification. The goal was to enhance the model's ability to distinguish flawed instances in representing figures accurately. Below are the sample from the dataset.

### 3. Model Selection and Validation

During the model selection process, three models were chosen. Firstly, a basic CNN model was employed, utilizing shallow convolutional neural networks. Additionally, we incorporated the sparse convolutional model proposed by Sunghaba (2017), as it was considered one of the novel sketch classifiers at the time of this project's creation. Furthermore, we made necessary modifications to adapt the model to our specific requirements.
