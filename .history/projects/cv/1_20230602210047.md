**Project description:** Drawings have been interpreted in various ways throughout different periods, making it challenging to provide a definitive definition. These drawings, created using different techniques, have been utilized to assess a child's intelligence. Numerous studies have examined children's drawings, including Goodenough's (1926) research, which involved extracting information from the depicted subject to predict mental age and intelligence quotient (IQ). Additionally, computer-aided tests have become increasingly significant in recent research, as they offer a more suitable approach for detecting categorical drawing characteristics using mathematical models.

Therefore, the aim of this project is to computerize Goodenough's (1926) research. By utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the sketch processor, the project classifies drawings into specific mental age categories and determines corresponding intelligence quotient (IQ) based on its learned or trained knowledge. Three methods were employed for image processing: the Basic CNN Structure, CNN Architecture with Sparse Matrix, and CNN Architecture with Sparse Matrix (Halved). These methods were tested using two types of fully connected layers: 256 and 512 Fully Connected Layers.

Among the trained methods, the Basic Model with a 512 fully connected layer demonstrated the highest performance, achieving a validation accuracy of 92% and a training accuracy peak of 82%. The Confusion Matrix displayed an accuracy of 89.97% and an error rate of 0.10, while the Categorical Cross Entropy yielded an accuracy of 89.97% and a score of 32.20%. Consequently, this model was selected for further analysis. This project provides evidence of the computer's potential to predict a child's Intelligence Quotient based on their drawings.

### 2. Data Gathering and Augmentation

The Draw-a-Person test (Goodenough, 1926) was administered to elementary pupils of NDMU-IBED using paper and pencil to assess their ability to draw a person. Prior to conducting the test, permission was obtained from the school authorities.

To improve the accuracy of the results and ensure reliable labels, additional data was included in this study from examples found in Goodenough's book (1926). These examples had been validated by the author. This addition helped increase the sample size and filter out classes with insufficient data.

After collecting the drawings, we scanned and processed them by removing noise, trimming whitespace, and resizing them to 150 by 150 pixels. Removing of noise involves drawing a hull around the image. Any points that are below the threshold stroke are not included in the hull. Subsequently, data augmentation was performed by rotating the drawings between -45 to 45 degrees. This was done to ensure that the figure represented a person and to provide a diverse dataset for the model. Overlapping in the drawings could potentially lead to misrepresentation by the CNN model, which is why a whitespace border was added to prevent this. Additionally, we clustered drawings that were misinterpreted or obstructed in a specific way, allowing the model to learn and prevent misclassification. The intention behind this approach was to enable the model to recognize and distinguish bad examples.
