### 2. Detecting the passenger

The app currently employs conventional computer vision techniques to accomplish the following tasks:

Differentiate the foreground object (i.e., passenger) from the background.
Identify pixels that belong to the same foreground object.
These operations involve standard computer vision procedures such as erosion, dilation, background subtraction, and contour detection.

### 3. Recognizing the Passenger

The app measures the “color distribution” associated with a person upon going up the vehicle.

The app uses the “color distribution” to recognize a person upon going down the vehicle.
