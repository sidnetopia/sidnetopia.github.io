**Project description:** The purpose of this app is to enable automatic counting and monitoring of the passenger count as they embark and disembark the vehicle at various stops.

### 2. Detecting the passenger

Detecting the Passenger
The app current uses traditional computer vision methods to:

-   Separate the foreground object (i.e., passenger) from the background.
-   Recognize pixels belonging to the same foreground object.

This involves only classical CV operations involved:

-   Erosion
-   Dilation
-   Background subtraction
-   Contour detection

### 3. Model Selection and Validation

During the model selection process, three models were chosen. Firstly, a basic CNN model was employed, utilizing shallow convolutional neural networks. Additionally, we incorporated the sparse convolutional model proposed by Sunghaba (2017), as it was considered one of the novel sketch classifiers at the time of this project's creation. Furthermore, we made necessary modifications to adapt the model to our specific requirements. The best model sparse convolutional model was selected with an F1-score of 80% on test set. Below are the model architecture, and confusion matrix.
