## Mutual Learning Approach to Distracted Driver Behavior Detection

**Project description:** Distracted driver behavior recognition aims to prevent accidents by alerting drivers of distracted driving. This study investigates the potential mutual learning between specific-object detectors to improve accuracy by combining their results to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the driver's cabin space. The recognized scene is then used to reevaluate the predicted objects and their locations within the cabin, such as the driver's face, hands, steering wheel, cigarette, handphone, sandwich, coffee mug, and more.

### 2. Detecting the passenger

The app currently employs conventional computer vision techniques to accomplish the following tasks:

Differentiate the foreground object (i.e., passenger) from the background.
Identify pixels that belong to the same foreground object.
These operations involve standard computer vision procedures such as erosion, dilation, background subtraction, and contour detection.

### 3. Recognizing the Passenger

The application quantifies the "color distribution" linked to an individual as they board the vehicle.

The application utilizes the "color distribution" to identify an individual as they disembark from the vehicle.

Subsequently, the application computes the "similarity" between the image of the departing passenger and each passenger present inside the vehicle.

The application then chooses the image that exhibits the highest level of similarity.
