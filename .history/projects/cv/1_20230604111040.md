## Predicting Intelligence Quotient of Children Through a Drawing Application

**Project description:** This project aims to computerize Goodenough's (1926) research on children's drawings by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a sketch processor. Three image processing methods were employed, including a basic CNN structure, CNN architecture with sparse matrix, and CNN architecture with sparse matrix (halved). The performance of these methods was evaluated using fully connected layers of different sizes. Among them, the basic model with a 512 fully connected layer demonstrated the highest performance with a validation accuracy of 92% and a training accuracy peak of 82%. The selected model shows the potential of computers in predicting a child's Intelligence Quotient (IQ) based on their drawings.

### 1. Overview of the Project

First part of this project is building, selecting, and evluating models using the collected dataset. The second part of this to deploy the model in an application. This project works by first, having the children draw a man representation. The model then classifies the drawing according to the drawing's mental age (M1 for random or sketch drawings and M2-M16 for mental age of 2 to 16). Using the mental age classification along with the drawer's age, the IQ is computed by the system.

### 2. Data Gathering and Augmentation

The Draw-a-Person test was administered to elementary pupils to assess their ability to draw a person. Additional data from Goodenough's book was included to improve accuracy and increase the sample size. The collected drawings underwent scanning, noise removal, whitespace trimming, and resizing. The dataset was split and augmented by rotating the drawings. Misinterpreted or obstructed drawings were clustered to a certain classto train the model to recognize and avoid misclassification. The goal was to enhance the model's ability to distinguish flawed instances in representing figures accurately. Below are the sample from the dataset.

### 3. Model Selection and Validation

During the model selection process, three models were chosen. Firstly, a basic CNN model was employed, utilizing shallow convolutional neural networks. Additionally, we incorporated the sparse convolutional model proposed by Sunghaba (2017), as it was considered one of the novel sketch classifiers at the time of this project's creation. Furthermore, we made necessary modifications to adapt the model to our specific requirements. The best model sparse convolutional model was selected with an F1-score of 80% on test set. Below are the model architecture, and confusion matrix.

The CNN sparse matrix plays a crucial role in sketch classification. It is particularly significant because it effectively captures the sparse and unique nature of sketches. Unlike traditional dense matrices, which represent all the pixels in an image, the sparse matrix only represents the relevant and distinctive features of the sketch. This sparse representation helps reduce computational complexity and memory requirements, making it more efficient for sketch classification tasks. By utilizing the CNN sparse matrix, the model can focus on the essential elements of the sketch and extract meaningful features that contribute to accurate classification results.
