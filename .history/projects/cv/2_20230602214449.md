### 2. Detecting the passenger

The app currently employs conventional computer vision techniques to accomplish the following tasks:

Differentiate the foreground object (i.e., passenger) from the background.
Identify pixels that belong to the same foreground object.
These operations involve standard computer vision procedures such as erosion, dilation, background subtraction, and contour detection.

### 3. Recognizing the Passenger

The application quantifies the "color distribution" linked to an individual as they board the vehicle.

The application utilizes the "color distribution" to identify an individual as they disembark from the vehicle.
