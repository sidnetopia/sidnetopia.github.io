### Detecting the passenger

The app currently employs conventional computer vision techniques to accomplish the following tasks:

-   Differentiate the foreground object (i.e., passenger) from the background.
-   Identify pixels that belong to the same foreground object.

These operations involve standard computer vision procedures such as erosion, dilation, background subtraction, and contour detection.

### 3. Recognizing the Passenger

The application utilizes the "color distribution" to identify an individual as they disembark from the vehicle.

Subsequently, the application computes the "similarity" between the image of the departing passenger and each passenger present inside the vehicle.

The application then chooses the image that exhibits the highest level of similarity.
