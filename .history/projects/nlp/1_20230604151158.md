## Predicting Stock Market Price Movement using NLP on Reddit Data

**Project description:** There have been a lot of discussions about the financial market in Reddit and WallStreetBets. Conversations on these possibly have the ability to influence the stock market. The goal of this project is to leverage the Reddit text data to predict a stock market movement. To utilize the text data, I employed sentence embedding, document embedding, and Neural Network (NN) models. Accordingly, this project examines several NN architecture and text data. Results show that text-based model can outperform the naive forecasting approach.

### Embeddings

I used the SBERT [[3]](#3) to transform texts into sentence
embeddings. I fine-tuned [[4]](#4) to generated embeddings with
dimensions of 768.
I also generated a 50 vector sizes document embeddings
using the body trained in Doc2Vec [4].

### Architecture

The following modules were used on top of the embedding, as shown in Figure 1, to enhance the analysis:

-   **Sentence CNN Module**: This module takes the title as input and utilizes SBERT to generate sentence embedding vectors. These vectors are then fed into a CNN model to extract relevant information.

-   **Document CNN Module**: Instead of individual sentences, the body text is converted into document embeddings, which are then used as inputs for the CNN model. This module operates similarly to the Sentence CNN Module.

-   **Title Mentions Module**: In addition to the title text data, I examined the impact of the number of title mentions on the model's accuracy. This module specifically focuses on this relationship.

-   **Body Mentions Module**: Similar to the Title Mentions CNN Module, this module investigates the correlation between body mentions and accuracy in the model's predictions.

### 2. Exploratory data analysis

I conducted the following data processing and exploration procedures to facilitate model development:

-   **Data cleaning**: The collected data was cleaned by converting it to lowercase and removing web links, symbols, and stop words.

-   **Data exploration**: I compiled a list of US stocks and extracted the counts of mentions in both the title and body of the text. Specifically, I focused on stocks that were frequently mentioned in financial news related to Reddit stocks.

-   **Model target**: For the model target, I selected market movement, which is calculated as follows:

    -   Movementt =
        -   1 if x > r
        -   0 if -r ≤ x ≤ r
        -   -1 if x < -r
    -   Here, x represents Opent - Closet (the difference between the opening and closing prices), and r is the threshold (in this case, 0.003). The Movementt can be categorized as an up, neutral, or down movement. This differs from [1] as my focus is on the movement rather than the actual price. It is also reasonable to consider the movement because small price changes may be insignificant due to higher transaction costs.

-   **Embeddings**:
    Like [1], I used the SBERT to transform texts into sentence
    embeddings [3]. I fine-tuned [4] to generated embeddings with
    dimensions of 768.
    I also generated a 50 vector sizes document embeddings
    using the body trained in Doc2Vec [4].

The Draw-a-Person test was administered to elementary pupils to assess their ability to draw a person. Additional data from Goodenough's book was included to improve accuracy and increase the sample size. The collected drawings underwent scanning, noise removal, whitespace trimming, and resizing. The dataset was split and augmented by rotating the drawings. Misinterpreted or obstructed drawings were clustered to train the model to recognize and avoid misclassification. The goal was to enhance the model's ability to distinguish flawed instances in representing figures accurately. Below are the sample from the dataset.

### 3. Model Selection and Validation

During the model selection process, three models were chosen. Firstly, a basic CNN model was employed, utilizing shallow convolutional neural networks. Additionally, we incorporated the sparse convolutional model proposed by Sunghaba (2017), as it was considered one of the novel sketch classifiers at the time of this project's creation. Furthermore, we made necessary modifications to adapt the model to our specific requirements. The best model sparse convolutional model was selected with an F1-score of 80% on test set. Below are the model architecture, and confusion matrix.

The CNN sparse matrix plays a crucial role in sketch classification. It is particularly significant because it effectively captures the sparse and unique nature of sketches. Unlike traditional dense matrices, which represent all the pixels in an image, the sparse matrix only represents the relevant and distinctive features of the sketch. This sparse representation helps reduce computational complexity and memory requirements, making it more efficient for sketch classification tasks. By utilizing the CNN sparse matrix, the model can focus on the essential elements of the sketch and extract meaningful features that contribute to accurate classification results.
