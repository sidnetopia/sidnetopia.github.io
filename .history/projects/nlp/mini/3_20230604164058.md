## Part of Speech Tagger

**Project description:** The Part-of-Speech Tagger is a Python-based project that utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to perform part-of-speech tagging on text in various languages. Part-of-speech tagging is the process of assigning grammatical tags to words in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. This project focuses on providing an efficient and accurate way to perform part-of-speech tagging, enabling applications in natural language processing, information extraction, sentiment analysis, and more.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tag.stanford import StanfordPOSTagger as POS_Tag
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Download required NLTK data
    nltk.download('punkt')

    # Define the directory and file names for the POS tagger
    tagger_dir = '/home/sidnetopia/Documents/nlp/assignments/part_of_speech_tagging/pos/tagger'
    tagger_model = 'filipino-left5words-owlqn2-distsim-pref6-inf2.tagger'
    tagger_jar = 'stanford-postagger.jar'

    # Initialize the POS tagger with the provided model and JAR file
    pos_tagger = POS_Tag(f"{tagger_dir}/{tagger_model}", f"{tagger_dir}/{tagger_jar}")

    # Define a list of example sentences to be tagged
    text_list = [
        "Pumunta sa palengke ang Hapon.",
        "Pumunta sa palengke ang Hapon kaninang hapon.",
        "Hapong-hapo ang Hapon na pumunta sa palengke kaninang hapon."
    ]

    # Iterate over each sentence in the list
    for text in text_list:
        # Print the current sentence
        print(f"Sentence: {text}")

        # Tokenize the sentence into words
        words = word_tokenize(text)

        # Perform POS tagging on the words using the tagger
        tagged_words = pos_tagger.tag(words)
        print(tagged_words)

        # Print each word along with its corresponding POS tag
        for word, word_class in tagged_words:
            print(word + "_" + word_class)

        # Print a blank line for readability between sentences
        print(" ")
```

This code snippet demonstrates the usage of the NLTK library to perform Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging on Filipino text. It utilizes the Stanford POS Tagger, which requires the model file and JAR file to be specified. The example sentences are provided in a list, and each sentence is tokenized into words using NLTK's word_tokenize function. The pos_tagger.tag method is then used to tag each word with its corresponding POS tag. The results are printed, with each word and its POS tag displayed on a separate line for readability.
